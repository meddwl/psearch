# PSearch - 3D ligand-based pharmacophore modeling

PSearch is a tool to generate 3D ligand-based pharmacophore models and perform virtual screening with them.

## Installation

```bash
pip install psearch
```

## Dependency

`pmapper >= 0.3.1`

## Example

### Creation of ligand-based pharmacophore models
It is recommended to create an empty dir which would be your `$PROJECT_DIR` and copy an input file to that location.  
There are two steps of pharmacophore model generation.  

> **_NOTE:_**  On a mac, all the commands may need to be prefixed by "python3 -m" since there are conflicting versions of python installations

1. Dataset preparation. 

```python
psearch.prepare_datatset -i $PROJECT_DIR/input.smi -c 4
```
`-i` - path to the input file  
`-c` - number of CPUs to use  
There are some other arguments which one can use. Invoke script with `-h` key to get full information.  

The script takes as input a tab-separated SMILES file containing `SMILES`, `compound id`, `activity` columns without a header. 
The third column should contain a word `active` or `inactive`.
The script splits input compounds on active and inactive subsets, generates stereoisomers and conformers, creates databases of active and inactive compounds with labeled pharmacophore features.  

2. Model building.  

```python
psearch -p $PROJECT_DIR -c 4
```
`-p` - path to the project dir  
`-c`- number of CPUs to use

There are two other arguments which are worth to mention:  
`-t` - threshold for compound clustering to create training sets. Default: 0.4.  
`-ts` - strategies to create training sets. `1` - a single training set will be created from centroids of individual clusters (capturing a common binding mode for all compounds). `2` - multiple training sets will be created, one per cluster (capturing individual binding modes for compound clusters).
By default both strategies are used.  

### Virtual screening with pharmacophore models 

1. Database creation. 

The script takes as input a tab-separated SMILES file containing `SMILES` and `compound id` columns.

```python
psearch.prepare_db -i $PROJECT_DIR/compounds.smi -o $PROJECT_DIR/compounds.db -c 4 -v
```
`-i` - path to the input file  
`-c` - number of CPUs to use
`-v` - print progress  
There are other arguments available to tweak database generation. To get the full list of arguments invoke `-h` key.
 
2. Virtual screening.
  
```python
psearch.scripts.screen_db -d compounds.db -q $PROJECT_DIR/models/ -o $PROJECT_DIR/screen_results/ -c 4
```
`-d` - input generated SQLite database  
`-q` - pharmacophore model or models or a directory with models   
If a directory would be specified all pma- and xyz-files will be recognized as pharmacophores and will be used for screening  
`-o` - path to an output directory if multiple models were supplied for screening or a path to a text file    
`-c`- number of CPUs to use

## Documentation

All scripts have `-h` argument to retrieve descriptions of all available options and arguments.
